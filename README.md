# Step 11 - Serve a secure local server

Service workers can only be used on a web page with a secure connection, served over https protocol.

Execute `npm run server` command to run a local http server. When you run a local http server on localhost/127.0.0.1, Chrome makes an exception to run service workers on this non-secure origin to help developers maintain their dev environment. You can see your service worker in action when you reach your local http server over http://localhost:8080

Emulated devices access to our computer network over `10.0.2.2` IP address. So, the exception that Chrome does on `localhost` origin does not apply to emulated device because the origin over there is different - `10.0.2.2`.

In this step, we're going to emulate a secure Firebase hosting environment on our local device. It will shorten the feedback loop of testing our app on a production like environment - avoiding deployment every time we make a change.

## Inspect non-secure server on the emulated device

Execute `npm run server` command to run a local http server. The server should be accessible via your computer over http://localhost:8080 and service workers should be enabled when accessed over localhost.

Launch an emulated device on Android Studio AVD. Open Chrome on emulated mobile device and navigate to http://10.0.2.2:8080.

Open Chrome DevTools Remote Devices to inspect the remote mobile device. You should see that there's no service worker attached to your client.

## Generate a local certificate

We're going to use `mkcert` library to generate a key and certificate. 

mkcert automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root store, and generates locally-trusted certificates. mkcert does not automatically configure servers to use the certificates though, we'll do that manually later on.

### Install mkcert

Execute following commands to install mkcert with brew if you're using macOS.

```
brew install mkcert
brew install nss
```

If you use another OS, see mkcert docs for installation guidelines: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert

Run the following to install the mkcert's root certificate for your system:
```
mkcert -install
```

### Generate a key and certificate for our origins

mkcert can generate a key and certificate to secure multiple origins. We're going to target `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and of course `10.0.2.2` origins. 

Execute the following command in your project root to generate a key and certificate file.

```
mkcert localhost 10.0.2.2 127.0.0.1
```

You should have 2 files showed up in you project's root folder:

```
localhost+2.pem
localhost+2-key.pem
```

### Add the pem files to `.gitignore`

Since the key and certificate file we just generated are unique to our setup, we need to ignore them in project.

Open `.gitignore` file and add the following line to ignore all the files with `.pem` extension:
```
*.pem
```

## Create a node middleware to serve a secure server

We were using `superstatic` package from the start on when we execute `npm run server` and `npm run build:serve`. 

You can see how those scripts are translated into `superstatic` commands by inspecting the `package.json` file in the project.

[Superstatic](https://github.com/firebase/superstatic) is a static HTTP server library built by firebase dev teams which allows you to configure SPAs utilizing History API, and it's configuration is as same as Firebase hosting configuration. So, it's a perfect fit in our stack.

Here, we will add a nodejs middleware to serve superstatic server over HTTPS protocol.

### Create a new server folder 

Create a new `server` folder in your project root. And, create a new `https.js` file in it.

### Add the middleware script

Open `https.js` file you've just created, located in `server` folder.

Copy the below middleware code to it:

```javascript
const superstatic = require('superstatic');
const connect = require('connect');
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const keyFile = process.argv[2];
const certFile = process.argv[3];

const spec = {
  config: {
    public: './www',
    rewrites: [{
      source: '**',
      destination: '/index.html'
    }]
  },
  cwd: process.cwd()
};

const httpsOptions = {
  key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),
  cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile)
};

const app = connect().use(superstatic(spec));

https.createServer(httpsOptions, app).listen(443, (err) => {
  if (err) { console.log(err); }
  console.log('Superstatic serves at https://10.0.2.2 on emulator and at https://localhost on desktop ...');
});
```

### Add the HTTP redirection to the middleware

One of the PWA audits of Lighthouse is about HTTP redirection. It expects the server that hosts the PWA to redirect to a secure protocol when users requested a non-secure HTTP protocol.

Add the following to the end of the `https.js` file:

```javascript
// Redirect to https
const http = require('http');
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(301, { "Location": "https://" + req.headers['host'] + req.url });
  res.end();
}).listen(80);
```

This will handle 301 redirects when the origin is accessed over a non-secure HTTP protocol.

### Test the secure protocol on your computer

Execute the following command in your project root to run the middleware script with the key and certificate arguments pointing out the files you've created in your project root.

```
node server/https.js localhost+2-key.pem localhost+2.pem
```

Now your secure local server should be up and running. Try to navigate to your app with https://localhost or https://127.0.0.1 urls.

## Update npm scripts for easier node execution

Open `package.json` file and add the following scripts right below `server` script:

```json
"server:https": "node server/https.js localhost+2-key.pem localhost+2.pem",
"build:serve:https": "npm run build:prod",
"postbuild:serve:https": "npm run server:https",
```

From now on, we will run the secure local server by executing `npm run server:https`

When we want to build for production and then serve it on a local server over HTTPS protocol, we're going to execute `npm run build:serve:https`

## Access to your secure local server on emulated mobile device

Launch your emulated mobile device using Android Studio AVD. Over the Chrome app in your emulated mobile device, navigate to https://10.0.2.2 address.

You should be getting `Your connection is not private` error on Chrome.

<img width="502" alt="11-3-ssl-error" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2641384/73658222-4716c480-4694-11ea-8d39-694239f06a3c.png">

This is the expected behaviour because `mkcert` root certificate is not installed on the device yet.

Tap on `Advanced` and then tap again on `Proceed to 10.0.2.2 (unsafe)`.

<img width="504" alt="11-4-unsafe" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2641384/73658223-4716c480-4694-11ea-8cbb-f265db706f52.png">

Now you can access to the app but since the connection is not safe, your service worker is not registered, and Chrome does not display `Add to home screen` bar. 

Let's install the missing root certificate on emulated device to fix both of those issues.

### Install mkcert root certificate on emulated device

Execute the following script on your computer to locate the directory keeping the root certificate:

```
mkcert -CAROOT
```

Navigate to the folder keeping the root certificate and drag and drop the key and the cert files `rootCA-key.pem`, `rootCA.pem` to the emulated device. 

Dragged files are uploaded to `Downloads` folder of the emulated device.

#### Install the certificate

Within the mobile device, navigate to:

`Settings` > `Security & Location` > `Encryption & Credentials` > `Install from SD Card` > `Downloads` screen. 

<img width="509" alt="11-5-uploaded-files" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2641384/73658225-4716c480-4694-11ea-951e-96393dd718a5.png">

Tap on `rootCA.pem` file to install the root certificate. Give any name to the cert and proceed with the installation.

<img width="511" alt="11-6-install-root-cert" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2641384/73658227-4716c480-4694-11ea-9903-a19fc3d2ce2f.png">

### Test the secure protocol on emulated device

On your emulated device, close the Chrome app and relaunch it. Then navigate to https://10.0.2.2 address. 

Now you can enjoy a secure connection on emulated device environment. You should see the mini A2HS bar showing up at the bottom of the screen.

<img width="522" alt="11-8-mini-info-bar" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2641384/73658260-5138c300-4694-11ea-935d-b5133022769e.png">

## Good to go ðŸŽ¯

Now you can continue to Step 12 -> [Test the A2HS functionality on Android](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-workshop-angular-firebase/blob/step-12/README.md).
